        <!-- story text -->   
<p>I was sitting on a subway bench in silence between two husky figures whose faces I never saw. They both wore heavy coats adorned with diadems of acrylic fur and rubber emblems depicting crude arctic themes. Their padded arms pressed against mine. I was watching my thoughts chug along, one by one, like subway cars: linked to one another, full of faces you forget right away, if you notice them at all. The train stopped; the doors opened. A clangorous voice echoed in the platform, suddenly becoming very loud and startling some passengers near the rear door. He stepped into the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anybody gonna fuckin&rsquo; give me money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were about fifty or sixty passengers in the car, just enough for every seat to be taken&mdash;either by a person, or in one case by a smear of vomit&mdash;and leave about ten standing. Nobody turned. Instead they watched him in the bleared periphery of their immobile vision. They pretended not to notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anybody gonna give me any fuckin&rsquo; money? Two quarters, a dollar, is anybody on this train gonna spare any money? Nobody on the last train gave me shit. They were all assholes. One lady on the Q gave me a fuckin&rsquo; dollar today. That was it. Only one dollar on the whole fuckin&rsquo; Q train. Yeah, I fuckin&rsquo; hate askin&rsquo; for money. You think I like askin&rsquo; for money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was pacing up and down the car. He was thin and pale. Indeed he had what you need for a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t-fuck-with-me&rdquo; face&mdash;small caustic eyes, clotted beard, imperviousness to smiling of any sort&mdash;but he looked altogether too tragic to inspire fear. He shuffled around in the typical hobo uniform of this feudal, flagellating city: dark solid colors, pants groaning with a surfeit of collapsing pockets, a burglar&rsquo;s beanie. He passed me several times, since I was sitting near the middle of the subway car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry and I don&rsquo;t have anywhere to sleep. If I get seven-fifty I can go to the chicken spot and get a sandwich, and I can stay there for a few hours. If I get thirteen-fifty I can post up at Burger King, wait until they come to kick me out and then go and order nuggets. I can do that three times if I get thirteen-fifty. If I get four-fifty I&rsquo;ll go get a fuckin&rsquo; slice and a Pepsi and sit there for all of ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t hear a rawer, more authentic pitch on the subway. It was a perfect performance for the fact that it was no performance at all. No artifice&mdash;just suffering. I was moved. I am always moved by the homeless. I was especially moved now. I&rsquo;ve come to know many varieties of subterranean panhandler: acrimonious immigrant, whimpering runaway, humiliated father of four, disgraced gambler, reformed divorc&eacute; desperate for custody. This man belonged to none of them. He did not weaponize tears or time-tested gambits or premeditated pathos. Maybe he had tried all of that already. Now there was nothing left but brutal recognition&mdash;evacuated acceptance&mdash;of his misery.</p>
<p>I admire those who use their voice to ask for help. It takes courage and perseverance. After all, the alternative is to sit behind some desolate signage, and that seems so much easier and less embarrassing. But now that I am jobless I rarely give, even to the bravest mendicants. Someone else should give. Those who have should give. The old have. They should give. There were many hoary, wrinkled men and women on this train, but none of them gave. Nobody gave, but the older passengers <em>especially</em> didn&rsquo;t give. Everyone stared blankly into space or squinted at their phones&mdash;especially the older passengers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I just need one person on this train to give me something, so I can fuckin&rsquo; eat tonight. Come on. I know you have money. I&rsquo;m fuckin&rsquo; poor. You think I like being fuckin&rsquo; poor? All I need is seven-fifty for a chicken sandwich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could stand it no longer. I reached for my wallet, unfastened the coin-purse flap, and emptied the change into my hand. Extending my fist, I released the coins into his palm as he came by. He looked at it for a moment and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This guy just gave me thirty-six cents.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t counted the change, so it&rsquo;s possible he was exaggerating for effect. The portly young lady on the opposite bench smirked at me. Her exposed ankles were boiling with nasty insect bites. I looked around&mdash;everyone else avoided eye contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anybody else gonna give me money? I just need four fuckin&rsquo; dollars and fourteen cents. Four fuckin&rsquo; dollars and fourteen cents and I can buy myself a slice and a Pepsi. Maybe if the landlords in this city weren&rsquo;t so fuckin&rsquo; greedy, and you didn&rsquo;t have to wait in line for nine fuckin&rsquo; hours to get food, there wouldn&rsquo;t be eighty thousand homeless people in this city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point a woman standing nearby handed him a dollar bill. I thought she looked rather stately, wearing expensive fabrics and a sort of knowing, ambassadorial expression. She was the third and final person in this bright, galloping hallway to acknowledge him. The train stopped again, and the doors opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll fuckin&rsquo; see you all in six hours when I&rsquo;m back on this train askin&rsquo; for money again.&rdquo;</p>
