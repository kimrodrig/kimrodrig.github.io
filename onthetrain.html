                <h1>On The Train</h1>
                <br>
        <!-- story text -->   
<p>
    I was sitting on a subway bench in silence between two husky figures whose
    faces I never saw. They both wore heavy coats adorned with diadems of
    acrylic fur and rubber emblems depicting crude arctic themes. Their padded
    arms pressed against mine. I was watching my thoughts chug along, one by
    one, like subway cars: linked to one another, full of faces you forget
    right away, if you notice them at all. The train stopped; the doors opened.
    A clangorous voice echoed in the platform, suddenly becoming very loud and
    startling some passengers near the rear door. A man stepped into the car
    shouting.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    “Is anybody gonna fuckin’ give me money?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
    There were fifty or sixty passengers in the car, enough for every seat to
    be occupied—either by a person, or in one case by a smear of vomit—and
    leave about ten standing. Nobody turned. Instead they watched him in the
    bleared periphery of their immobile vision. They pretended not to notice.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    “Is anybody gonna give me any fuckin’ money? Two quarters, a dollar, is
    anybody on this train gonna spare any money? Nobody on the last train gave
    me shit. They were all assholes. One lady on the Q gave me a fuckin’ dollar
    today. That was it. Only one dollar on the whole fuckin’ Q train. Yeah, I
    fuckin’ hate askin’ for money.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
    He was pacing up and down the car. He was thin and pale. Indeed he had the
    necessary ingredients for a “don’t-fuck-with-me” face—small caustic eyes,
    clotted beard, imperviousness to smiling of any sort—but he looked
    altogether too tragic to inspire fear. He shuffled around in the typical
    hobo uniform of this feudal, flagellating city: dark solid colors, pants
    groaning with a surfeit of collapsing pockets, a burglar’s beanie. He
    passed me several times, since I was sitting near the middle of the subway
    car.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    “I’m hungry and I don’t have anywhere to sleep. If I get seven-fifty I can
    go to the chicken spot and get a sandwich, and I can stay there for a few
    hours. If I get thirteen-fifty I can post up at Burger King, wait until
    they come to kick me out and then go and order nuggets. I can do that three
    times if I get thirteen-fifty. If I get four-fifty I’ll go get a fuckin’
    slice and a Pepsi and sit there for all of ten minutes.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
    You won’t hear a rawer, more authentic pitch on the subway. It was a
    perfect performance for the fact that it was no performance at all. No
    artifice—just suffering. I was moved. I am always moved by the homeless,
    but I was especially moved now. I’ve come to know many varieties of
    subterranean panhandler—acrimonious immigrant, whimpering runaway,
    humiliated father of four, disgraced gambler, reformed divorcé sighing for
    custody—and I affirm this man belonged to none of them. He was in a class
    of his own. He did not weaponize tears or time-tested gambits or
    premeditated pathos. Maybe he had tried all of that already. Now there was
    nothing left but brutal recognition—evacuated acceptance—of his misery.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I admire those who use their voice to ask for help. It takes courage and
    perseverance. After all, the alternative is to sit behind some desolate
    signage, and that seems so much easier and less embarrassing. To orate
    before an audience intent on ignoring your existence is no easy task. But
    now that I am jobless I rarely give, even to the bravest mendicants.
    Someone else should give. Those who have should give. The old have. They
    should give. There were many hoary, wrinkled men and women on this train,
but none of them gave. Nobody gave, but the older passengers    <em>especially</em> didn’t give. Everyone stared blankly into space or
    squinted at their phones—especially the older passengers.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    “I just need one person on this train to give me something, so I can
    fuckin’ eat tonight. Come on. I know you have money. I’m fuckin’ poor. You
    think I like being fuckin’ poor? All I need is seven-fifty for a chicken
    sandwich.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I could stand it no longer. I reached for my wallet, unfastened the
    coin-purse flap, and emptied the change into my hand. Extending my fist, I
    released the coins into his palm as he came by. He looked at it for a
    moment and frowned.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    “This guy just gave me thirty-six cents.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I hadn’t counted the change, so it’s possible he was exaggerating for
    effect. The portly young lady on the opposite bench looked at me and
    smirked. Her exposed ankles were boiling with nasty insect bites. I looked
    around—everyone else avoided eye contact.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    “Is anybody else gonna give me money? I just need four fuckin’ dollars and
    fourteen cents. Four fuckin’ dollars and fourteen cents and I can buy
    myself a slice and a Pepsi. Maybe if the landlords in this city weren’t so
    fuckin’ greedy, and you didn’t have to wait in line for nine fuckin’ hours
    to get food, there wouldn’t be eighty thousand homeless people in this
    city.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
    At this point a woman standing nearby handed him a dollar bill. I thought
    she looked rather stately, wearing expensive fabrics and a knowing,
    ambassadorial expression. She was the third and final person in this bright
    galloping hallway to visibly acknowledge him. The train stopped again, and
    the doors opened.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    “Yeah, I’ll fuckin’ see you all in six hours when I’m back on this train
    askin’ for money again.”
</p>
<br>
