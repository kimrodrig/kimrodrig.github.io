                <h1>The Neighbor</h1>
                <p>During the first few weeks in our new apartment, our next-door neighbors tried to schedule dinner with us in order to establish a good neighborly rapport. I suspected things had gone sour with the previous tenant of the apartment. I knew nothing about Christian Kaczmarczyk, aside from the fact that the neighbors had never had him over for dinner and that he had moved out in four months prior. Nonetheless, I still felt his presence linger, especially on the wall above the main door, where one of his pictures had left a rectangle of grime. There were other reminders that this apartment was used, that it had a past life. They came to my mailbox every day, two, three, four times a day. They were addressed to Christian, but I was the one who received them, the artifacts of his junk-strewn life: preapproved credit cards, supermarket catalogs and penis enlargement rebates, coupons for buxom Nigerian massages, leaflets from the hirsute satellite guys, regular proposals from lawyerly panhandlers and usurious electronics vendors, even the odd holiday card with enfolded check ($100; uncashable) and thoughtless scribble (‘hope your job is everything you want it to be!’). Every day I leafed through the stack on the way up the stairs, seldom finding anything for my roommate Asa or me among the brochures and cards and envelopes which all bore his hideous optometrist’s exam of a name, and every day I threw them all away.</p>
