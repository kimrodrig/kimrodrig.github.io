                <h1>The Neighbor</h1>
                <br>
        <!-- story text -->   

<p>During the first few weeks in our new apartment, our next-door neighbors tried to schedule dinner with us in order to establish a good neighborly rapport. I suspected things had gone sour with the previous tenant of the apartment. I knew nothing about Christian Kaczmarczyk, aside from the fact that the neighbors had never had him over for dinner and that he had moved out four months prior. Nonetheless, I still felt his presence linger, especially on the wall above the main door, where one of his pictures had left a rectangle of grime. There were other reminders that this apartment was used, that it had a past life. They came to my mailbox every day, two, three, four times a day. They were addressed to Christian, but I was the one who received them, the artifacts of his junk-strewn life: preapproved credit cards, supermarket catalogs and penis enlargement rebates, coupons for buxom Nigerian massages, leaflets from the hirsute satellite guys, regular proposals from lawyerly panhandlers and usurious electronics vendors, even the odd holiday card with enfolded check ($100; uncashable) and thoughtless scribble (‘hope your job is everything you want it to be!’). Every day I leafed through the stack on the way up the stairs, seldom finding anything for my roommate Asa or me among the brochures and cards and envelopes which all bore his hideous optometrist’s exam of a name, and every day I threw them all away.</p>

<p>Is it possible to make a clean move anymore? When so many companies and marketers and decriminalized loan sharks already have your information, can you really move <em>away </em>from an old address and into a new one? Or are you just attracting more fresh spam somewhere new? You can make a new email, get a new phone number, move to a new address, but what do you think happens to the old ones? They keep ringing, receiving, piling up. Think of the millions of abandoned inboxes that continue to overflow every day: it makes sense, since unbridled spam was the reason they were abandoned in the first place. With paper mail it’s an even more obvious waste, not just the paper, the ink, but the delivery, the manpower, all so farcically worthless. There’s somebody living at your old address now who has to ignore and discard all your junk, over and over again, forever. And you yourself, in turn, have moved into someone <em>else’s</em> place, now you’re getting <em>their</em> shit. Sometimes you even get something addressed to somebody who hasn’t lived there in a decade, who lived there eight tenants ago, who’s long dead.</p>

<p>It’s all the same shit though, in the end, this flurry of advertisements, no matter whose name is printed on them. Sometimes they’ll even admit it: “Christian Kaczmarczyk<em> or Current Resident</em>.” It’s all the same trash, asinine advertisements from a bygone era, untargeted, or so loosely targeted as to miss the mark entirely, selling things you wouldn’t even take for free. Three times a week they subject me to a reverse prescription scheme in which they commend a sunny medication with a Basque name that the patient is supposed to convince the doctor to prescribe him. They might as well pitch a credit card where everything costs you twice as much but in return they promise to stop artificially lowering your credit score. It’s all trash, and I don’t want it coming to my house. I didn’t order any of it. Christian didn’t order it all either, but he did live here long enough for them to catch on. Me, I’m new here, I deserve my grace period.</p>
<br>
<p>Our neighbors, Anders and Karina, tried for a good while to schedule dinner with us, with Asa and me, but it turned out to be difficult to arrange. Thursday was no good, Anders worked late Sunday to Wednesday, on a given Friday I had a visiting friend, and then Karina had other plans, Asa was away for a weekend, and so on. They were friendly and so were we. We peppered the group chat with exclamation points, we exchanged apologies and tortured emojis, we explained that we had no dietary restrictions. Finally we agreed to come over on Friday evening. They lived across the hall, so we didn’t even put on shoes. We rang the buzzer.</p>

<p>Karina opened the door. I thought she looked like an interrupted baker. Like a busy baker you’ve surprised on the job, merry by nature, but flustered by the distraction, impatient to get back to the trays and steam and crackling dough. Indeed, she was already turning to the stove. </p>

<p>“Come in, come in! I’m sorry, I’m just finishing up here.”</p>

<p>We walked in through the narrow kitchen. Karina seemed tense.</p>

<p>Karina was cooking the first time I’d met her too. The scene was almost identical, with a profusion of pots and pans and angry steam behind her. There was quite a bit of noise; the roaring kitchen fan nearly swallowed her voice. Cooking can be loud business. You can do it quietly, tiptoeing around, muting potlids, but some people simply don’t care, they chop parsley like it’s lumber, they blend ice cubes at all hours. In my apartment I would occasionally hear cymbals crashing through the wall. I believe this is a matter of upbringing; in my house, my heedful father would grind coffee in the garage even if we were all upstairs. </p>

<p>Now, with all four burners blazing, her kitchen was as loud as ever. Asa, who didn’t like loud noises unless they were produced by a female in his bedroom, was frowning. The fan was on hurricane mode. Dear lord, I needed earplugs in here! It was like she was conducting a renegade orchestra, with each instrument having gone rogue, soup surging off queue, teapot whistling early, timer missing its clangorous entrance, and she was there trying madly to subdue them, the frying pan sputtering too loudly and in the wrong tempo, the gurgling pot refusing to decrescendo, the eccentric smoke detector—the critic in the balcony—prepared to howl at any moment.</p>

<p>“Where’s Anders?” Asa was nearly yelling. </p>

<p>“Yes!” she said. “It’s my mother’s recipe. I think you’ll like it.” She beamed waxily at him. </p>

<p>The second time I met Karina, down in the lobby, she looked the same. Rosy, hurried, her eyes twinkling with fading kindness and fading youth. Evidently this was just what she looked like. Maybe she had been attracted to cooking by a natural predilection which expressed itself in her appearance as well. Or maybe years of standing over the stove, wincing over sliced onions, sniffing fragrant methane, scalding fingers, maybe all of that time spent in the tensest room in the house, in the home laboratory, had left its mark.</p>

<p>“There he is,” I said.</p>

<p>Anders strode over in a tailored baby blue shirt. He had excellent posture, almost too upright, in the kind of stance only shorter men seem to manage. Anders was about forty years old, blond, gregarious, with a fondness for drinking. He slapped the wall and the kitchen fan stopped. He smiled, squeezed my hand first, then Asa’s. </p>

<p>“Welcome, welcome. Can I get you guys something to drink? I was going to make pink ladies.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” I said. </p>

<p>“Yeah, sure,” said Asa.</p>

<p>Right away he started working, separating egg whites. This was a bit awkward, with both of the hosts working back to back in the kitchen, while Asa and I stood there conspicuously, doing nothing. It would have been better to come later. Dinners are like movies: you’re actually more on time if you’re 15 minutes late than you are if you’re on time. I groped for something to say.</p>

<p>“Have you ever been a bartender?” I asked. </p>

<p>He twirled and shook a chromium canister with exaggerated ease. I hoped he hadn’t taken this as an insult.</p>

<p>“I haven’t worked as a bartender in almost twenty years, but I do know my way around a bar. I open restaurants for a living. All my restaurants have bars, obviously, and I’m there for twelve hours a day, but I try not to drink much at work, and when I do, it’s usually wine, and one of the younger guys will serve me. I drink a lot at home though. Mostly wine, but also cocktails. We both do. Sometimes we’ll have one drink every night for a week. Recently we had a Morning Glory week: I made Morning Glories every night, and they were getting better every day, though we were getting more and more hungover. When we have guests over I like to put in the effort.”</p>

<p>“Too bad I don’t have any cash, I’d love to leave you a tip,” said Asa.</p>

<p>Anders chuckled. He was good-natured—I liked him. He measured out the gin.</p>

<p>“One time, my roommate threw a party in our apartment. This was about ten years ago, when we were living in the Upper West Side. He was in law school, and invited some of his classmates. I started making drinks. For some reason word spread about the party and about 60 people showed up. I was literally the only one there who wasn’t in law school. I got stuck mixing drinks all night. One guy even gave me tip.”</p>

<p>“How much?” I asked. </p>

<p>“Five. Then they all left. The apartment was completely trashed. I ended up cleaning 60 glasses all night.”</p>

<p>“Did you have a dishwasher?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How did you have 60 glasses?” Karina asked.</p>

<p>“I just did.”</p>

<p>He handed each of us a glass. The liquid was sunset-pink, delicious.</p>

<p>“This is really good,” I said. </p>

<p>“Thanks. Shall we go into the living room?”</p>

<p>We chatted in the living room for a while about the building, and Denmark—where Anders was born and lived until he was eight—and the crazy downstairs neighbors who were covering the security camera with duct tape and stealing their cat food packages, and their cats, of which there were five. Karina made periodic trips to the kitchen, and Asa, who was feigning interest in her houseplants, followed her around with syrupy affirmations such as “Not everybody has what it takes to water plants every day and keep them from dying.” Anders refilled my glass twice. I was surprised to learn that he was leaving for a monthlong trip to Saudi Arabia the next day. Some shadowy entrepreneur had visited one of Anders’s high-end Manhattan restaurants and revealed a plan to open a similar establishment in Riyadh, which apparently was now considered up-and-coming. Anders had recommended himself. It all happened so fast, he said. He was going to open a restaurant from scratch, and he was going to be ‘handsomely compensated.’ The plane tickets themselves, apparently, cost $8,000 each way. There would be showers on board. I imagined the diverse clientele that he might serve: inevitable Apple Watch people on their way to or from Abu Dhabi, wrinkled sheikhs with backs like scimitars, chortling Japanese businessmen, Russian nabobs on shady business, hooded dark-eyed ladies. He mentioned again that was leaving tomorrow; this prompted Karina to reopen an ongoing quarrel about how much (or how little) packing he had left to do. </p>

<p>At least four of the five cats were stretching and swaggering around the living room like they owned the place. I fought back the urge to sneeze for about twenty minutes by clenching my teeth and pushing my tongue against the roof of my mouth. I’m allergic to cats, but the effects are not severe. My cat allergy, I’ve noticed, makes me behave more like a cat: quiet, slightly autistic, making frequent unexplained trips to other rooms. Cats behave strangely but rather predictably, and so do I when I’m around them, due to my allergy. Allergies are a lot like cats themselves. They’re mysterious and secretive, they disregard others in favor of their own interests, and you never quite know when they’re going to betray you. There’s also the odd fact that those who possess them—cats or allergies—tend to have an obsessive need to brag about them to the those of us who don’t care. </p>

<p>Nevertheless during dinner I felt that I needed to explain my wheezing and sniffling and multiple trips to the bathrooms for toilet paper. </p>

<p>“I’m slightly allergic to cats. I apologize.”</p>

<p>“Oh no! Is there anything we can do?” Anders was sincere.</p>

<p>“No, no, it’s fine. I hardly even notice. I usually forget until about an hour in, when my nose starts to tickle.”</p>

<p>Asa looked up from his smeared plate suddenly, as if remembering something.</p>

<p>“This is delicious, Karina. Thank you.”</p>

<p>We finished a second bottle of wine. Anders went to get a third.</p>
<br>
<p>After dinner, feeling pleasantly light, I invited the couple come over for a quick tour of our apartment, which Anders had last seen empty while it was still on the market. We gave them a quick tour, and in return they offered platitudes about the furniture and ‘layout’ and talked about how it looked so different from theirs despite being the exact converse. Settling on opposite couches, we returned to the topic of the crazy downstairs neighbors. Anders had called the cops on them multiple times for noise complaints. Apparently they were disposed to shaking the whole building with loud bass-driven music at surprising hours like midnight or 2 in the morning. Asa said that last week he had seen a woman (who was not the wife) sneak into the apartment through the second door and heard subsequent yelling from at least one female voice and one male voice and then what sounded like a thrash of dropped suitcases. </p>

<p>We finished the bottle, and Anders went to fetch another. Karina had a drowsy smile. She touched Asa’s knee when she got up to use the bathroom. Anders returned with a bottle of white and cannabis mints. </p>

<p>“Another splash?” </p>

<p>I extended my glass. At this point Asa decided to stop drinking. I put two mints in my mouth and washed them down with wine.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bed,” Karina yawned. </p>

<p>“Okay, good night honey,” said Anders. He was engrossed in the story he was telling about how his old roommate once accidentally ate weed brownies Anders had left out on the morning of an important exam and failed it miserably.</p>

<p>Asa rose to go to the bathroom. After about ten minutes I realized he must have gone to sleep. The world was starting to blur around the edges. I suddenly registered that I hadn’t listened at all to what Anders had said for quite a long time. </p>

<p>“…and he would always give me a suspicious look in the hallway. After we first met you, I told Karina, finally, somebody <em>normal </em>! But I always had a bad feeling about Christian. He would drop by when I was at work to bring Karina packages from the lobby, or cookies, or to play with the cats, but he never came by when I was home. At first I thought it was a coincidence, since I’m at work a lot, but I started feeling like he somehow knew when I was home. I thought it was strange. And whenever I brought it up, Karina would change the subject. In general I’m not a jealous guy. One time I found a man’s sock under the bed. When I asked her about it, she said that the cats must have brought it in from outside. It’s not impossible—we let them out a lot.”</p>

<p>“Well, Asa says he sees the cats out on the fire escape a lot. I don’t know, it seems like you two have a good relationship. This Christian guy sounds like a real dick. He’s probably just creepy. There’s no excuse for giving your neighbor the stink-eye on the stairs. I don’t like him. I keep getting his junk mail. Anyway, you’re lucky we’re here now; you won’t have Christian to worry about while you’re away.”</p>

<p>Anders nodded. My phone buzzed in my pocket; it was Asa:</p>

<p>“keep anders distracted. i’m in their bedroom with karina. she texted me. i came in thru the fire escape” </p>

<p>That naughty rascal! He was always putting me in these kinds of situations.</p>
