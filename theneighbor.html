                <h1>The Neighbor</h1>
                <br>
                
                <p>During the first few weeks in our new apartment, our next-door neighbors tried to schedule dinner with us in order to establish a good neighborly rapport. I suspected things had gone sour with the previous tenant of the apartment. I knew nothing about Christian Kaczmarczyk, aside from the fact that the neighbors had never had him over for dinner and that he had moved out in four months prior. Nonetheless, I still felt his presence linger, especially on the wall above the main door, where one of his pictures had left a rectangle of grime. There were other reminders that this apartment was used, that it had a past life. They came to my mailbox every day, two, three, four times a day. They were addressed to Christian, but I was the one who received them, the artifacts of his junk-strewn life: preapproved credit cards, supermarket catalogs and penis enlargement rebates, coupons for buxom Nigerian massages, leaflets from the hirsute satellite guys, regular proposals from lawyerly panhandlers and usurious electronics vendors, even the odd holiday card with enfolded check ($100; uncashable) and thoughtless scribble (‘hope your job is everything you want it to be!’). Every day I leafed through the stack on the way up the stairs, seldom finding anything for my roommate Asa or me among the brochures and cards and envelopes which all bore his hideous optometrist’s exam of a name, and every day I threw them all away.</p>

<p>Is it possible to make a clean move anymore? When so many companies and marketers and decriminalized loan sharks already have your information, can you really move <em>away </em>from an old address and into a new one? Or are you just attracting more fresh spam somewhere new? You can make a new email, get a new phone number, move to a new address, but what do you think happens to the old ones? They keep ringing, receiving, piling up. Think of the millions of abandoned inboxes that continue to overflow every day: it makes sense, since unbridled spam was the reason they were abandoned in the first place. With paper mail it’s an even more obvious waste, not just the paper, the ink, but the delivery, the manpower, all so farcically worthless. There’s somebody living at your old address now who has to ignore and discard all your junk, over and over again, forever. And you yourself, in turn, have moved into someone <em>else’s</em> place, now you’re getting <em>their</em> shit. Sometimes you even get something addressed to somebody who hasn’t lived there in a decade, who lived there eight tenants ago, who’s long dead.</p>

<p>It’s all the same shit though, in the end, this flurry of advertisements, no matter whose name is printed on them. Sometimes they’ll even admit it: “Christian Kaczmarczyk<em> or Current Resident</em>.” It’s all the same trash, asinine advertisements from a bygone era, untargeted, or so loosely targeted as to miss the mark entirely, offering things you wouldn’t even take for free. Three times a week they subject me to a reverse prescription scheme in which they commend a sunny medication with a Basque name that <em>I</em>, sick but wise consumer, am supposed to convince <em>my doctor</em> to prescribe me. They might as well pitch a credit card where everything costs you twice as much but in return they promise to stop artificially lowering your credit score. It’s all trash, and I don’t want it coming to my house. I didn’t order any of it. Christian didn’t order it all either, but he did live here long enough for them to catch on. Me, I’m new here, I deserve my grace period.</p>
